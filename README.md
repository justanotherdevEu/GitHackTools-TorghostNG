# GitHackTools-TorghostNG
                              ALL THIS Tor-GhostNG REPOSITORY IS NOT MINE, I did not write even one of those lines

This repository is from old site https://github.com/githacktools/TorghostNG but, i downloaded it from https://github.com/84KaliPleXon3/GitHackTools-TorghostNG

i ignore the reason why profile githacktools from Github got deleted, but i would prefer to copy here so it keeps protected.

For my eyes, seems like an in-danger-of-extinction repository, so here it will remain 

for it's use, first of all u should use it on Linux or at least a Virtual Machine with Linux
on a website i read this tool was tested on Kali Linux, Manjaro, also...

TorghostNG currently supports:

    GNU/Linux distros that based on Arch Linux
    GNU/Linux distros that based on Debian/Ubuntu
    GNU/Linux distros that based on Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, openSUSE
    Solus OS
    Alpine Linux
    OpenWrt Linux
    Void Linux
    Anh the elder guy: Slackware
